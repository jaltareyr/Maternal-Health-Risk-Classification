# Maternal Health Risk Dataset

This is a machine learning classification problem. I am using the [Maternal Health Risk](https://www.archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/863/maternal+health+risk) dataset. It has six feature columns:
- `Age`
- `SystolicBP`
- `DiastolicBP`
- `BS`
- `BodyTemp`
- `HeartRate`
- `RiskLevel`

There are 3 class values:
- `high risk`
- `low risk`
- `mid risk`
